## CSS Animations 

In order to experiment with difficulty. The next step in this project will be using just raw CSS to replicate the same animations used earlier.

### Test 1 

Simple Background Animation uses keyframs and CSS to control animations. The fundamental problem I ran into with this method made it very difficult ot bind keys and other actions as well as start and stop the animation. This led me to using Angular Animation Library instead. [Library](https://angular.io/guide/animations)
